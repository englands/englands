## Hi there | Hola 👋 I'm Stephanie.

# I'm passionate about ensuring people's lives are safe while engaging in online business. 
## I would love to work as a financial crimes analyst in the intelligence community or government agency. 

### My eighth-grade career assessment was right when it said I should become a data scientist. It took me until the end of college to realize it.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on refreshing my SQL knowledge from my undergraduate career, and learning R. I am also trying to build a repository of Tableau projects to demonstrate proficiency with the software.
- 🌱 I’m learning SQL and R. I hope that my experience with SQL and R can help me get a better grasp on Python.       
- 📫 How to reach me: Connect with me on LinkedIn or by email at [els5@usf.edu](mailto:els5@usf.edu).
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her/hers/ella
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I am not working, I love working as an event volunteer, listening to music, or attending entertainment events!
