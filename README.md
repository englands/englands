## Hi there 👋 I'm Stephanie.

# I am an aspiring Data Scientist with a passion for helping others. 
## I would love to work as a data analyst, data scientist, or data manager for a federal government agency in the intelligence community.

### My eighth-grade career assessment was right when it said I should become a data scientist. It took me until the end of college to realize it.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on studying for the Tableau Desktop Specialist exam, which I will be taking in August.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Tableau (honing in my skills for the exam), Python, and R.
- 📫 How to reach me: Connect with me on LinkedIn or by email at [els5@usf.edu](mailto:els5@usf.edu).
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her/hers/ella
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I am not working, I love working as an event volunteer, listening to music, or going to entertainment events!
